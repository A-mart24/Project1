# LANDMARKD


# Our Task:
The website that group 10 has come up with for our first group project is a landmark review site appropriately titled LandMarkd. On this website, users would be able to search for their favorite landmark and then write a brief review or leave  tips that could then be seen by other users of the website. Users start by searching up a landmark which then brings up some info and a video, then if they are so inclined users are presented with a form to fill out where they can leave their review/tip.
# User Story:
AS A traveler
I WANT a website to search for any destination
SO THAT I can write a review or leave local tips.

# How to use
Users will be able to easily search for their favorite destination as soon as they open the page,once they clicked search, information and video will be displayed along with a photo gallery of that specific destination.
Should the user want to write a review, the website has a built in form to write a review and save it in local storage.
